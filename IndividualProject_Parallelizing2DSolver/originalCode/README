Description for added features on advectionSolver (adv2)

1. Options added 
 -i: exits just after one iteration.
   default: no

 -e floating_number: turns on the memory corruptor with the given probability
  (default: no) 
    eg) -e 0.00000001

 -H number(1-3): specifies the size of boundary of halo array (default: 3)
    eg) -H 3

 -t: use TMR (default: no)

 -x stencil: select a stencil to use. cannot select multiple stencils.
  stencil: NN2, NW2, NF2, WN2, WW2, WF2, FN2, FW2 and FF2 (from Brendan)
           XX (use the previous implementation) (default: all (NN2, NW2, NF2))
  eg) -x XX, -x NF2, ...

 -a: use alternating stencils between (NN2, NW2, NF2) and (NN2, WN2, FN2)
  (default: no)
 
 -w: exclude first iteration time from the total elpased time (default: no)

2. Implementation notes
 - Current implementation assumes only 2D case, thus For TMR, VT and VhT use ix
   and ihx without modification, using k for t. For TMR of the 3D case, ix and
   ihx should be extended for (i,j,k,t). Please refer to Advect2D.cpp.

 - run3dAdvect.multi is a simple script for running multiple node. 
   Variables, HOSTS, TDIR and PREFIX, in the script should be modified
   appropriately.

 - We need to clearfy qsort() behavior for Nan and Inf.

3. Compile options
 - _ENABLE_ALL_STS_: specifies to use all 9 stencils, compute 9 stencils and
  take the median of them.

 - __MEM_COPRRUPTOR__: enable memory corrupter.
